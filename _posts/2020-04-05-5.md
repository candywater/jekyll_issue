### Service File Location

we can find many service in linux.  

Let's take a look at Nginx.service

```
$ sudo systemctl status nginx
● nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sun 2019-03-31 12:50:17 UTC; 32min ago
 Main PID: 2839 (nginx)
   CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
           ├─2839 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx
           └─2840 nginx: worker process
```

and if we type such command like this

```
$ sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
```
Created symlink from 
/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/nginx.service to 
/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service.
```

A symbolic link will be created.

### Put Your Service File Here

here is where you should write service

```
/usr/lib/systemd/system/service-name.service
```

then use the following command

```
$ sudo systemctl enable service-name
```

### Service File Layout

here is nginx service file.

```
[Unit]
Description=The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/run/nginx.pid
# Nginx will fail to start if /run/nginx.pid already exists but has the wrong
# SELinux context. This might happen when running `nginx -t` from the cmdline.
# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1268621
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/rm -f /run/nginx.pid
ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
KillSignal=SIGQUIT
TimeoutStopSec=5
KillMode=process
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Write Your Service File

this is just a little complex.  
here is a simple one.


```
[Unit]
Description=this is a description
After=you can copy from nginx.service

[Service]
Type=simple   
ExecStart=/usr/bin/something /home/your-script
KillMode=process
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=your-program-id-in-syslog
Environment=YOUR_VAR=xxxx
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
- Type <- at most time simple is enough, sometimes you may need a forking[1](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html)

- Environment <- this is something you may need

- Restart <- the best thing I like, your service will never down

- multi-user.target <- this is for "enable", multi-user.target which means command line use is simple output[2](https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/install-desktop-environments-centos-7/)

<!--

```
$ cat /run/nginx.pid
2839
```

```
/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mysqld.service

[Unit]
...

[Install]
...

[Service]
...
...
Restart=always
...

```
```
# Restarting/reloading
systemctl daemon-reload # Run if .service file has changed
systemctl restart
```

```
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/kjc_back.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/kjc_back.service.
```
-->

### Conclusion

Write a Original Service File, and put it into 

```
/usr/lib/systemd/system/
```

then just start & enable it via systemctl.
